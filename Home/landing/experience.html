     Joining the tech
        </h2>
 <p>My journey in web development began when I started university.<br>
            I gained my first experience in developing static pages using HTML. <br> Through this experience, I learned the basic tags of HTML and how can i work simple pages using those tags. <br> When I looked at different web pages, I noticed that mine didn't look professional. <br> So, I decided to improve it by applying additional HTML tags like &lt;center&gt;. <br> but I realized that there are other languages that enhance the appearance of pages. <br> Therefore, I moved on to CSS to elevate the beauty of my simple web pages.</p>

    consistency
        </h2>
 <p>In my opinion, consistency is the most crucial aspect to learn web development.<br>
   After I grasped the main concepts of HTML and CSS, one of the struggles that challenged me was consistency, especially in CSS. <br> Unlike HTML tags, CSS operates on a broader concept, which requires more daily practice compared to HTML. <br>To enhance my understanding, I utilized W3Schools to learn CSS concept each day, and this approach helped me solidify my knowledge of styling pages.

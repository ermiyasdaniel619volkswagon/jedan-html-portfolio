        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>
          I am a full-stack web developer with experience building secure,
          responsive, and user-centered web applications. <br />
          I specialize in modern JavaScript technologies, particularly the MERN
          stack, and enjoy transforming complex ideas into practical digital
          solutions. <br />
          My focus is on creating applications that are easy to use,
          well-structured, and scalable. <br />
          I am especially interested in developing systems that solve real-world
          problems and improve everyday workflows.

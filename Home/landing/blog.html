      <p>
        This page is meant to share my understanding of the web development
        world and my perspective on it. <br />
        As you know, web development is a lifelong journey, and I learn new
        things every time I struggle with a bug. <br />I also gain insight into
        how the web really works and I'm passionate about creating something new
        by integrating the tools and technologies I come across.

        <h2>Understanding Semantic HTML</h2>

        <p>
          For me, understanding the meaning of HTML tags is essential.
          <br />Consider this: if you need to communicate with someone who
          speaks Amharic, you must understand the meaning, even if you catch all
          the words to converse with that person. <br />
          You need to choose which word is most suitable for the situation.
          <br />
          Similarly, HTML works in the same way; even if you know all the tags,
          you must decide when and where to use each tag.
